# Implementing a Stack with a Singly Linked List

## The Stack

A **stack** is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to the **last-in**, **first-out** (**LIFO**)principle. A user may insert objects into a stack at any
time, but may only access or remove the most recently inserted object that remains (at the so-called “top” of the stack).

## The Singly Linked List

A singly linked list, in its simplest form, is a collection of nodes that collectively
form a linear sequence. Each node stores a reference to an object that is an element
of the sequence, as well as a reference to the next node of the sequence.
